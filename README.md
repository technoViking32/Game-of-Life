## How it works
How it works

Cells: 
- Each cell in the grid can be either alive or dead.

Generations: 
The game proceeds in generations. In each generation, the following rules apply:

- A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. Â  
- A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. Â  

Controls:
- Start: Begins the simulation.
- Clear: Clears the current grid.
- Random: Generates a random initial pattern.
- Change the color: Alters the color of live cells.

## Features
- Dark mode: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- Color palette: Choose from a variety of colors for the cells.
- Presets: Load predefined patterns.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
- Tailwind
